  - [x] Set up a GitHub repository with `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  

- **1.2 - Basic Teams and Processes**  
  - [x] Launch **Tigrao**, responsible for creating the Pre-Project Document.  
  - [x] Launch **Bob**, to generate schedules and spreadsheets.  
  - [x] Launch **Dallas**, to create the Roadmap based on the schedule and Pre-Project Document.  

- **1.3 - Automation**  
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines on GitHub for automated testing and deployment.  
  - [ ] Implement basic commit control with automatic improvements.  

### **Expected Delivery:**  
Functional base of the SoftwareAI framework with initial teams active.

  - [x] Conduct extensive testing of all features.  
  - [x] Fix bugs and improve performance.  

- **2.5 - CoreApp Refactoring**  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/Agents` folder: Each team contains its subfolder inside 'Agents'.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/FirebaseKeys` folder: Contains OpenAI keys and Firebase app keys.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/Flowchart` folder: Contains all software-AI flowcharts and mind maps.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/SoftwareAI` folder: Contains the core file `SoftwareAI_Core`.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/SoftwareAI/Functions` folder: Contains all files for team functions and the initializer `_init_functions_`.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/SoftwareAI/Functions_Submit_Outputs` folder: Contains files to send function outputs to OpenAI, with `_init_submit_outputs_`.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/SoftwareAI/Instructions` folder: Contains `_init_Instructions_` and subfolders for team-specific instructions.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/SoftwareAI/Tools` folder: Contains `_init_tools_` and subfolders for team-specific tools.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/Work_Environment` folder: Workspace for teams where ByteManager names and creates subfolders for projects.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/_init_agents_`: Initializes all agents.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/_init_core_`: Initializes `SoftwareAI_Core`.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/_init_keys_`: Initializes keys and Firebase apps.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/_init_libs_`: Initializes all framework imports.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/_init_paths_`: Initializes all workspace paths.  
  - [x] Create `CoreApp/ambiente`: Environment variables file for storing all workspace paths.  

### **Expected Delivery:**  
A mature framework with basic team communication support.
